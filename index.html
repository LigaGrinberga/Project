							<br>The members that are in the group were not all in the original group lineup before their debut. There were supposed to be few other guys, that now are successful themselves.
							<br>BTS debuted in 2013 with their song No More Dream. The songs that BTS makes are easily relatable for young people, as they sing about following your own dreams and the hardships that all people face in their youth.
							<br>BTS is a group that actively participate in their album production. Suga, Rap Monster and J-Hope are the ones who compose the most.
							<br>They are serious and charismatic on stage but off-stage they are very fun and goofy off stage.
							<br>BTS fandom name is ARMY, which stands for Adorable Representative MC for Youth.
							<br>Their lightstick is shaped as a bomb.
